## What Is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language designed for fast and easy text formatting. Its goal is to be readable in plain text form while being easily converted to HTML, PDF, or other formats.

It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 and has since become a standard for writing technical documentation, README files, blogs, scientific notes, and even slides.

## Where Is Markdown Used?

Markdown is widely used in:

- **GitHub** — README files, documentation, comments  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — text cells  
- **Hugo / Jekyll / static site generators** — writing blog posts  
- **Notion, Obsidian, VS Code** — notes and personal wikis  
- **Blogging platforms and CMS** — as the primary input format  
- **Scientific papers and reports** — thanks to LaTeX support

- **Lists** — unordered (`-`, `*`) and ordered (`1.`, `2.`)  
- **Links and Images** — `[text](url)` and `![alt](image)`  
- **Blockquotes** — `> Quote`  
- **Code** — `\`inline code\`` and code blocks using indentation or triple backticks

- **MathJax / KaTeX** — LaTeX-style math formulas (`$E=mc^2$`)  
- **Mermaid** — embedded diagrams and flowcharts  
- **PlantUML** — inline UML diagram support
