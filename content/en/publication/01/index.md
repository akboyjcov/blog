## What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** refers to modern software development practices aimed at automating and accelerating the application lifecycle. The acronym stands for:

- **CI** — *Continuous Integration*
- **CD** — *Continuous Delivery* or *Continuous Deployment*

The goal of CI/CD is to simplify and automate the process of developing, testing, and releasing new versions of software — with minimal manual effort.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

**Continuous Integration** means that developers regularly merge their changes into the main branch of the repository. Each commit triggers automatic processes:

- Project build  
- Unit tests  
- Static code analysis  
- Code style checks  

This allows problems to be detected early — not at the release stage.

### Benefits of CI:

- Rapid detection of bugs  
- Fewer merge conflicts  
- Confidence in application stability after each change  
- Improved code quality

## Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD)

After successful integration, the next stage is **Continuous Delivery** — the application is automatically prepared for deployment at any moment. This includes:

- Building a release version  
- Running integration and end-to-end tests  
- Creating an artifact (e.g., Docker image)  
- Preparing release notes and updates  

When **Continuous Deployment** is added, the release is deployed to production automatically — *without human intervention* — if all checks pass.

## Components of a CI/CD Pipeline

A modern CI/CD pipeline consists of several automated stages:

1. **Source Control** — GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
2. **CI Server** — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI  
3. **Build & Test** — Make, Gradle, npm, pytest  
4. **Security Scanning & Linting**  
5. **Artifact Creation** — Docker, archives, binaries  
6. **Deployment** — Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Terraform  

Each stage is configured as part of a pipeline, usually described in YAML files.

## CI/CD in Practice

- In web development, each new feature is automatically tested and deployed  
- In mobile development, APK/IPA builds are triggered after a push to `main`  
- Python libraries can be auto-published to PyPI on commit  
- In scientific computing, CI can automate experiments and result updates

## Why Implement CI/CD?

CI/CD helps to:

- Reduce time between idea and release  
- Eliminate human errors in builds and deployments  
- Improve team collaboration  
- Reduce the burden on developers and DevOps engineers  
- Ensure stable releases and allow safe rollbacks

## Conclusion

CI/CD isn’t just a trendy buzzword — it’s a foundation of modern development. Even small projects benefit from automation: you’ll find bugs faster, release more often, and gain confidence in your code.

If you haven’t tried CI/CD yet, start small: automate your builds and tests. Soon, you'll see how much more efficient development becomes.
