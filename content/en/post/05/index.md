### ðŸ”¹ Final Push

This week I took the **exam in mathematical logic**. Formal proofs, predicate calculus, disjunctive and conjunctive normal forms. Sounds abstract â€” but after a couple of weeks, it actually became interesting.

I also passed the final **programming test** â€” submitted a project in Python, explained the code structure, and described the algorithm. Got praised for clean formatting and readability.

> The first exam session is over. A lot was new to me, but Iâ€™m glad I made it through.
