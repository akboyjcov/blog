### ðŸ”¹ A Week of Discoveries

The first half of the week was all about **programming practice**. We worked on a small Python project â€” a queue simulation. Focused on functions, lists, and input/output. It was a good opportunity to strengthen skills in loops and error handling.

In **calculus classes**, we discussed limits and the properties of continuity. A bit challenging, but the logic of the course is slowly starting to make sense.

> I realized: the more problems you solve, the less intimidating they become.
