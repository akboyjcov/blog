### ðŸ”¹ Math Marathon

The main focus of the week was the **calculus exam**. Topics included series, differentiation of multivariable functions, and integrals. I worked through the problem book almost nonstop. It was tough â€” but I passed! ðŸŽ‰

In programming class, we started preparing for the final test â€” discussed the principles of OOP, inheritance, and encapsulation. I began writing a file-handling wrapper class to get some extra practice.

> Logic is still ahead â€” need to keep up the pace.
