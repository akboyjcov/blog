### ðŸ”¹ Formulas and Code

It was a busy week. In **mathematical logic**, we dove into normal forms of logical expressions and learned to build truth tables. I especially enjoyed finding counterexamples â€” it really sharpened my analytical thinking.

During **programming classes**, we worked on a mini-project: a phonebook with functions for adding, deleting, and searching contacts. It reminded me how useful dictionaries and data structures can be.

> At the same time, I'm preparing for a calculus colloquium â€” still a lot of calculations ahead.
