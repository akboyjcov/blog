### 🔹 Retake Week

The main event of the week was the **make-up test in Operating Systems**. I failed the first attempt, but this time I prepared thoroughly: reviewed topics on schedulers, file systems, and thread synchronization. Finally passed! 💪

In addition, we practiced working with the Linux terminal: explored commands like `top`, `ps`, `kill`, `chmod`. I felt the real “system magic” — now I understand how things work under the hood.
