## Why Researchers Need a Personal Website

In the age of digital science, having your own website is not just a bonus — it’s a necessity. A personal academic website allows you to:

- Showcase your portfolio of publications, projects, and presentations  
- Increase the visibility of your research and simplify access to your work  
- Build a professional image and establish a central point of online presence  
- Facilitate communication with colleagues, students, and funding organizations  
- Publicly document progress, teaching, and new ideas  

One of the most convenient tools for creating such a site is **Hugo Academic** — a theme for the Hugo static site generator, designed specifically for academics and researchers.
